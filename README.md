# 1. INTRODUCTION AND PROJECT SCOPE

## 1.1 Project Overview

This project presents the development of a comprehensive Mission Design and Visualization Tool for spacecraft trajectory analysis. The software combines advanced orbital mechanics algorithms with real-time 3D visualization to create a practical tool for mission planning, orbital analysis, and aerospace education.

The primary objective is to build a software system capable of:

- Accurately propagating spacecraft orbits using numerical integration techniques
- Modeling real-world perturbations including atmospheric drag, Earth oblateness (J₂), and third-body gravitational effects
- Calculating optimal orbital maneuvers and transfer trajectories between different orbits
- Designing interplanetary missions with comprehensive launch window analysis
- Visualizing complex three-dimensional trajectories in an interactive real-time environment
- Providing quantitative analysis tools for mission delta-v budgets and performance metrics

## 1.2 Motivation

Mission design tools are essential in the aerospace industry, used extensively by organizations such as NASA, ESA, SpaceX, and emerging commercial space companies. While professional software packages exist (Systems Tool Kit, General Mission Analysis Tool), they are often expensive, complex to learn, and proprietary in nature.

This project aims to create an educational yet practical tool that demonstrates the fundamental principles of astrodynamics while remaining accessible, extensible, and open for further development. The tool serves multiple purposes: as a learning platform for aerospace engineering students, as a demonstration of software engineering capabilities applied to complex scientific problems, and as a foundation for future mission planning applications.

The growing commercial space industry requires engineers who understand orbital mechanics at a deep level. Hands-on experience with trajectory design, numerical propagation, and mission optimization is invaluable for anyone pursuing a career in aerospace engineering or space systems design.

## 1.3 Project Goals and Objectives

### Technical Objectives

1. **High-Fidelity Orbital Propagation:** Implement multiple numerical integration schemes (Euler, RK4, RK45 adaptive) with configurable time steps and error tolerances to accurately propagate spacecraft state vectors over extended time periods.

2. **Perturbation Modeling:** Develop accurate models for the primary orbital perturbations affecting Earth-orbiting satellites, including J₂ gravitational harmonics, atmospheric drag with density models, and lunar/solar third-body effects.

3. **Maneuver Optimization:** Create efficient algorithms for computing optimal orbital transfers, including Hohmann and bi-elliptic transfers, plane changes, and combined maneuvers with total delta-v minimization.

4. **Interplanetary Trajectories:** Solve Lambert's problem for two-point boundary value problems, enabling the design of Earth-to-Mars and other interplanetary transfer trajectories with porkchop plot generation.

5. **Real-Time 3D Visualization:** Build an intuitive graphics system using modern rendering techniques to display orbits, planetary bodies, spacecraft positions, and maneuver vectors in an interactive three-dimensional environment.

6. **Performance and Accuracy:** Ensure computational efficiency for real-time propagation while maintaining sufficient numerical accuracy for mission planning purposes.

### Learning Objectives

- Master fundamental orbital mechanics concepts from Kepler's laws through advanced perturbation theory
- Develop proficiency in numerical methods for solving ordinary differential equations
- Gain practical experience with 3D graphics programming and real-time rendering
- Practice software architecture design for complex scientific computing applications
- Learn validation and verification techniques for scientific software
- Understand the practical challenges of mission design and trajectory optimization

## 1.4 Scope and Limitations

### Project Scope

This project covers orbital mechanics from basic two-body Keplerian dynamics through advanced topics including:

- Earth-centric orbital propagation with perturbations
- Low Earth orbit through geostationary orbit regimes
- Orbital transfer maneuvers and optimization
- Interplanetary trajectory design within the inner solar system
- Both impulsive (instantaneous delta-v) and low-thrust (continuous acceleration) propulsion models
- Satellite constellation design and analysis

### Known Limitations

The following effects are not modeled in this implementation:

- **General Relativity:** Relativistic effects are negligible for most practical missions and are not included. For very high precision applications or near massive bodies, these effects would need to be added.

- **Attitude Dynamics:** Spacecraft orientation and rotation dynamics are simplified. Full three-axis attitude simulation with reaction wheels, thrusters, and environmental torques is beyond the current scope.

- **Propulsion Details:** Rocket engines are modeled as ideal thrust sources. Real engine characteristics including throttling, specific impulse variation, and thrust vector control limitations are simplified.

- **Atmospheric Modeling:** The Earth's atmosphere is modeled using an exponential density approximation. More sophisticated models (NRLMSISE-00) would be needed for high-fidelity drag predictions.

- **Higher-Order Gravity:** Only J₂ oblateness is modeled. Higher-order spherical harmonics (J₃, J₄, sectoral terms) are not included but could be added for improved accuracy.

# 2. FUNDAMENTAL ORBITAL MECHANICS

## 2.1 The Two-Body Problem

The foundation of orbital mechanics is the two-body problem, which describes the motion of two point masses under their mutual gravitational attraction. While simplified, this model provides accurate predictions for most spacecraft trajectories, particularly when one mass (like Earth) is much larger than the other (the spacecraft).

### Newton's Law of Universal Gravitation

The gravitational force between two masses is given by Newton's law:

```
F = -G(m₁m₂/r²)r̂
```
*Equation 2.1*

where:
- G = 6.674 × 10⁻¹¹ m³/(kg·s²) is the gravitational constant
- m₁, m₂ are the masses of the two bodies
- r is the distance between the centers of mass
- r̂ is the unit vector pointing from m₁ to m₂

### The Gravitational Parameter

For a spacecraft of negligible mass orbiting a much larger body (like Earth), we define the gravitational parameter μ:

```
μ = GM
```
*Equation 2.2*

For Earth: μ⊕ = 398,600.4418 km³/s²

### Equation of Motion

The acceleration of the spacecraft relative to Earth's center is:

```
d²r/dt² = -(μ/r³)r
```
*Equation 2.3*

This is a second-order vector differential equation that completely describes the spacecraft's motion in the absence of other forces. The negative sign indicates that the acceleration is always directed toward Earth's center.

### Conservation Laws

The two-body problem exhibits two fundamental conservation laws that are crucial for understanding orbital motion:

**Conservation of Energy:**  
The specific orbital energy (energy per unit mass) remains constant:

```
ε = v²/2 - μ/r = constant
```
*Equation 2.4*

This energy determines whether the orbit is elliptical (ε < 0), parabolic (ε = 0), or hyperbolic (ε > 0).

**Conservation of Angular Momentum:**  
The specific angular momentum vector remains constant in magnitude and direction:

```
h = r × v = constant
```
*Equation 2.5*

This proves that the orbit lies in a fixed plane perpendicular to h.

## 2.2 Kepler's Laws

Johannes Kepler empirically discovered three laws of planetary motion in the early 17th century. These laws, later proven by Newton to be consequences of his laws of motion and gravitation, provide fundamental insights into orbital behavior.

### Kepler's First Law: The Law of Ellipses

> **"The orbit of every planet is an ellipse with the Sun at one focus."**

More generally, bound orbits (ε < 0) are ellipses with the primary body at one focus. The shape of the ellipse is characterized by:

- **Semi-major axis (a):** Half the longest diameter of the ellipse
- **Eccentricity (e):** A measure of how elongated the ellipse is (0 ≤ e < 1 for ellipses)
- **Semi-minor axis (b):** Related to a by: b = a√(1 - e²)

Special cases:
- e = 0: Circular orbit
- 0 < e < 1: Elliptical orbit
- e = 1: Parabolic trajectory (escape)
- e > 1: Hyperbolic trajectory (flyby)

### Kepler's Second Law: The Law of Equal Areas

> **"A line joining a planet and the Sun sweeps out equal areas in equal times."**

This law is a direct consequence of angular momentum conservation. Mathematically:

```
dA/dt = h/2 = constant
```
*Equation 2.6*

where h is the magnitude of the specific angular momentum. This means the spacecraft moves faster when closer to Earth (at periapsis) and slower when farther away (at apoapsis).

### Kepler's Third Law: The Law of Periods

> **"The square of the orbital period is proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis."**

```
T² = (4π²/μ)a³
```
*Equation 2.7*

This fundamental relationship allows us to calculate the orbital period from the semi-major axis, or vice versa.

| Orbit Type | Altitude (km) | Semi-major Axis (km) | Period |
|-----------|--------------|---------------------|---------|
| ISS (LEO) | ~400 | 6,778 | ~92 minutes |
| GPS (MEO) | ~20,200 | 26,578 | ~12 hours |
| GEO | 35,786 | 42,164 | 24 hours |

## 2.3 Coordinate Systems

Accurate orbital mechanics requires careful definition of reference frames. We use several coordinate systems depending on the application.

### Earth-Centered Inertial (ECI) Frame

The primary reference frame for orbital calculations is the Earth-Centered Inertial (ECI) frame, specifically the J2000 epoch frame:

- **Origin:** Earth's center of mass
- **X-axis:** Points toward the vernal equinox (First Point of Aries) at epoch J2000.0 (January 1, 2000, 12:00 TT)
- **Z-axis:** Points toward the North Celestial Pole (Earth's rotation axis at J2000.0)
- **Y-axis:** Completes the right-handed system (in the equatorial plane, 90° ahead of X)

This frame is "inertial" in the sense that it doesn't rotate with Earth, making it suitable for applying Newton's laws of motion.

### Earth-Centered Earth-Fixed (ECEF) Frame

For ground station tracking and satellite coverage analysis, we use the rotating ECEF frame:

- **Origin:** Earth's center of mass
- **Z-axis:** Points toward the North Pole
- **X-axis:** Points toward 0° longitude (Greenwich meridian)
- **Y-axis:** Completes the right-handed system (points toward 90°E longitude)

This frame rotates with Earth at approximately 360°/24 hours = 15.04°/hour.

### Perifocal Coordinate System

For analyzing individual orbits, the perifocal frame is convenient:

- **Origin:** Primary body's center of mass
- **P-axis:** Points toward periapsis
- **W-axis:** Points in the direction of angular momentum (perpendicular to orbital plane)
- **Q-axis:** Completes the right-handed system (in the orbital plane, 90° ahead of periapsis)

### Coordinate Transformations

Converting between ECI and ECEF requires accounting for Earth's rotation:

```
r_ECEF = R_z(θ_GMST) · r_ECI
```
*Equation 2.8*

where θ_GMST is the Greenwich Mean Sidereal Time, which increases by approximately 360.985647° per day.

## 2.4 State Vectors and Equations of Motion

### State Vector Representation

The complete state of a spacecraft at any instant is described by its position and velocity vectors in an inertial frame:

```
State = [r, v] = [x, y, z, vₓ, vᵧ, vᵤ]
```
*Equation 2.9*

This six-dimensional vector completely determines the spacecraft's trajectory.

### First-Order Form of Equations of Motion

To facilitate numerical integration, we convert the second-order equation into a system of first-order differential equations:

```
dr/dt = v
dv/dt = -(μ/r³)r
```
*Equation 2.10*

In component form, this becomes six coupled first-order ODEs:

```
dx/dt = vₓ
dy/dt = vᵧ
dz/dt = vᵤ
dvₓ/dt = -μx/r³
dvᵧ/dt = -μy/r³
dvᵤ/dt = -μz/r³

where r = √(x² + y² + z²)
```

## 2.5 Numerical Integration Methods

Analytical solutions to the two-body problem exist, but they become complex when perturbations are added. Numerical integration provides a flexible approach that easily accommodates additional forces.

### Euler's Method (Forward Euler)

The simplest integration method approximates the derivative with a finite difference:

```
y(t + h) ≈ y(t) + h·f(t, y)
```
*Equation 2.11*

While easy to implement, Euler's method has poor accuracy (first-order) and stability. It's useful for initial testing but not recommended for production orbital propagation.

### Runge-Kutta 4th Order (RK4)

RK4 is the workhorse of orbital mechanics, providing an excellent balance of accuracy and computational cost. The algorithm evaluates the derivative at four points within each timestep:

```
k₁ = f(t, y)
k₂ = f(t + h/2, y + h·k₁/2)
k₃ = f(t + h/2, y + h·k₂/2)
k₄ = f(t + h, y + h·k₃)

y(t+h) = y(t) + (h/6)·(k₁ + 2k₂ + 2k₃ + k₄)
```

RK4 is fourth-order accurate, meaning the local truncation error is O(h⁵) and the global error is O(h⁴). For most orbital applications, a timestep of 10-60 seconds provides excellent accuracy.

### Adaptive Step-Size Methods (RK45)

For long-duration propagations or highly elliptical orbits, adaptive methods like Runge-Kutta-Fehlberg (RK45) automatically adjust the timestep to maintain a specified error tolerance:

- Near periapsis (high acceleration): Use smaller timesteps
- Near apoapsis (low acceleration): Use larger timesteps
- Maintain user-specified error tolerance throughout

> **⚠️ Energy Drift Warning:**  
> All numerical integrators introduce small errors that accumulate over time. For orbital mechanics, this manifests as energy drift - the total orbital energy slowly changes even though it should be conserved. For multi-day or multi-month propagations, consider using symplectic integrators or periodically correcting the energy to maintain accuracy.

## 2.7 Results and Validation

### Test Case 1: Circular Orbit

A circular orbit at 400 km altitude (ISS orbit):

| Parameter | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| Altitude | 400 km |
| Orbital radius | 6,778 km |
| Velocity (circular) | 7.669 km/s |
| Period (theoretical) | 92.68 minutes |
| Period (simulated, RK4, dt=10s) | 92.68 minutes |
| Energy drift (24 hours) | < 0.001% |

The circular velocity for any radius is given by:

```
v_circular = √(μ/r)
```
*Equation 2.12*

### Test Case 2: Elliptical Orbit

A highly elliptical Molniya-type orbit:

| Parameter | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| Periapsis altitude | 500 km |
| Apoapsis altitude | 39,000 km |
| Semi-major axis | 26,128 km |
| Eccentricity | 0.737 |
| Period (theoretical) | 11.967 hours |
| Period (simulated, RK4, dt=30s) | 11.967 hours |

### Energy Conservation Analysis

For the elliptical orbit test case, we monitored the specific orbital energy over 10 orbital periods:

- **Initial energy:** -7.622 km²/s²
- **Energy after 10 orbits:** -7.622 km²/s² (RK4, dt=30s)
- **Maximum energy deviation:** 0.0003% (3 parts per million)

This excellent energy conservation validates our RK4 implementation for practical use.

### Integration Method Comparison

| Method | Timestep | Steps/Orbit | Energy Error (10 orbits) | Position Error (10 orbits) |
|--------|----------|-------------|--------------------------|---------------------------|
| Euler | 10 s | 557 | 12.4% | 8,400 km |
| RK4 | 60 s | 93 | 0.08% | 54 km |
| RK4 | 30 s | 186 | 0.005% | 3.4 km |
| RK4 | 10 s | 557 | 0.0002% | 0.1 km |

As expected, RK4 vastly outperforms Euler, maintaining excellent accuracy even with larger timesteps.

**Recommended Timesteps:**
- **Real-time visualization:** 30-60 seconds
- **Mission analysis:** 10-30 seconds
- **High-precision ephemerides:** 1-10 seconds or adaptive RK45

# 3. 3D VISUALIZATION AND ORBITAL ELEMENTS

## 3.1 Classical Orbital Elements

While state vectors (position and velocity) completely describe a spacecraft's motion, they don't provide intuitive insight into the orbit's shape and orientation. The classical orbital elements offer a more geometric description that's easier to interpret and is standard in mission planning.

### The Six Keplerian Elements

A Keplerian orbit is completely characterized by six parameters:

| Element | Symbol | Description | Range |
|---------|--------|-------------|-------|
| Semi-major axis | a | Size of the orbit | a > 0 |
| Eccentricity | e | Shape of the orbit | 0 ≤ e < 1 |
| Inclination | i | Tilt from equator | 0° ≤ i ≤ 180° |
| RAAN | Ω | Right Ascension of Ascending Node | 0° ≤ Ω < 360° |
| Argument of periapsis | ω | Orientation in plane | 0° ≤ ω < 360° |
| True anomaly | ν | Position in orbit | 0° ≤ ν < 360° |

### Element Details

**Semi-major Axis (a):**  
Determines the orbital period and energy:

```
ε = -μ/(2a)
```
*Equation 3.1*

**Eccentricity (e):**  
The periapsis and apoapsis radii:

```
rₚ = a(1 - e)    [periapsis]
rₐ = a(1 + e)    [apoapsis]
```
*Equation 3.2*

**Inclination (i):**
- i = 0°: Equatorial orbit
- i = 90°: Polar orbit
- i ≈ 51.6°: ISS orbit

## 3.2 State Vector Conversions

### From State Vectors to Orbital Elements

```cpp
// Compute specific angular momentum
Vector3D h = r.cross(v);
double h_mag = h.magnitude();

// Node vector
Vector3D k(0, 0, 1);
Vector3D n = k.cross(h);
double n_mag = n.magnitude();

// Eccentricity vector
Vector3D e_vec = v.cross(h)/mu - r/r.magnitude();
double e = e_vec.magnitude();

// Semi-major axis
double energy = v.magnitude()*v.magnitude()/2 - mu/r.magnitude();
double a = -mu/(2*energy);

// Inclination
double i = acos(h.z / h_mag);

// RAAN
double RAAN = acos(n.x / n_mag);
if (n.y < 0) RAAN = 2*PI - RAAN;

// Argument of periapsis
double omega = acos(n.dot(e_vec)/(n_mag * e));
if (e_vec.z < 0) omega = 2*PI - omega;

// True anomaly
double nu = acos(e_vec.dot(r)/(e * r.magnitude()));
if (r.dot(v) < 0) nu = 2*PI - nu;
```

## 3.3 Graphics Implementation

### Rendering Pipeline

```cpp
while (!WindowShouldClose()) {
    UpdateCamera(&camera);
    
    if (isRunning) {
        currentState = propagator.step(currentState, timestep, mu);
        orbitTrajectory.push_back(currentState.position);
    }
    
    BeginDrawing();
    ClearBackground(BLACK);
    
    BeginMode3D(camera);
        // Draw Earth
        DrawSphere(Vector3Zero(), EARTH_RADIUS, BLUE);
        
        // Draw orbit trajectory
        for (size_t i = 1; i < orbitTrajectory.size(); i++) {
            Vector3 p1 = toRaylibVector(orbitTrajectory[i-1]);
            Vector3 p2 = toRaylibVector(orbitTrajectory[i]);
            DrawLine3D(p1, p2, YELLOW);
        }
        
        // Draw spacecraft
        Vector3 scPos = toRaylibVector(currentState.position);
        DrawSphere(scPos, 200, RED);
    EndMode3D();
    
    // Draw UI
    DrawUI(currentState, elements);
    
    EndDrawing();
}
```

## 3.4 User Interface Design

The UI displays critical orbital parameters in real-time:

# 4. ORBITAL PERTURBATIONS

## 4.1 J₂ Perturbation (Earth Oblateness)

### Physical Basis

Earth bulges at the equator due to rotation. The J₂ coefficient quantifies this:

```
J₂ = 1.08263 × 10⁻³
```
*Equation 4.1*

### Effects on Orbital Elements

J₂ causes:
- **Regression of nodes:** Orbital plane precesses around Earth's rotation axis
- **Rotation of apsides:** Line of apsides rotates within the orbital plane

### Secular Rates

```
dΩ/dt = -(3/2)·(n·J₂·R_E²/p²)·cos(i)
dω/dt = (3/4)·(n·J₂·R_E²/p²)·(5cos²(i) - 1)
```
*Equations 4.2, 4.3*

### Sun-Synchronous Orbits

A sun-synchronous orbit maintains a fixed angle with the Sun by setting dΩ/dt = 0.9856°/day.

For typical LEO altitudes (500-800 km), sun-synchronous inclinations are 97-99°.

### Implementation

```cpp
Vector3D computeJ2Acceleration(const Vector3D& position) {
    const double J2 = 1.08263e-3;
    const double RE = 6378.137;  // km
    
    double r = position.magnitude();
    double x = position.x;
    double y = position.y;
    double z = position.z;
    
    double factor = (3.0/2.0) * J2 * MU_EARTH * (RE*RE) / pow(r, 5);
    
    double ax = factor * x * (5*z*z/(r*r) - 1);
    double ay = factor * y * (5*z*z/(r*r) - 1);
    double az = factor * z * (5*z*z/(r*r) - 3);
    
    return Vector3D(ax, ay, az);
}
```

## 4.2 Atmospheric Drag

### Drag Force Model

For satellites below ~1000 km altitude:

```
F_drag = -(1/2)·ρ·v_rel²·C_D·A
```
*Equation 4.5*

where:
- ρ = atmospheric density (kg/m³)
- v_rel = velocity relative to atmosphere
- C_D = drag coefficient (~2.2)
- A = cross-sectional area (m²)

### Atmospheric Density Model

Exponential atmosphere:

```
ρ(h) = ρ₀·exp(-(h - h₀)/H)
```
*Equation 4.6*

| Altitude (km) | ρ₀ (kg/m³) | h₀ (km) | H (km) |
|--------------|-----------|---------|--------|
| 0-25 | 1.225 | 0 | 7.249 |
| 100-110 | 5.297×10⁻⁷ | 100 | 5.877 |
| 120-150 | 2.438×10⁻⁸ | 120 | 9.473 |

### Effects

- Semi-major axis decreases (orbit decays)
- Eccentricity decreases (orbit circularizes)
- Period decreases

> **⚠️ Orbital Decay:**  
> ISS at 400 km loses ~2 km/month to drag. At 300 km, satellites reenter in weeks without propulsion.

## 4.3 Third-Body Perturbations

The Moon and Sun perturb Earth satellites:

```
a_3rd = μ₃[(r₃ - r)/|r₃ - r|³ - r₃/|r₃|³]
```
*Equation 4.7*

Gravitational parameters:
- Moon: μ☾ = 4,902.8 km³/s²
- Sun: μ☉ = 1.327 × 10¹¹ km³/s²

# 5. ORBITAL MANEUVERS AND TRANSFERS

## 5.1 Impulsive Maneuvers

In mission design, we assume maneuvers are instantaneous velocity changes:

```
r⁺ = r⁻
v⁺ = v⁻ + Δv
```
*Equation 5.1*

The rocket equation:

```
Δv = I_sp·g₀·ln(m_initial/m_final)
```
*Equation 5.2*

## 5.2 Hohmann Transfer

The most fuel-efficient two-impulse transfer between coplanar circular orbits.

### First Burn (at r₁)

```
Δv₁ = √(μ/r₁)·[√(2r₂/(r₁ + r₂)) - 1]
```
*Equation 5.3*

### Transfer Time

```
t_transfer = π√[(r₁ + r₂)³/(8μ)]
```
*Equation 5.4*

### Second Burn (at r₂)

```
Δv₂ = √(μ/r₂)·[1 - √(2r₁/(r₁ + r₂))]
```
*Equation 5.5*

### Example: LEO to GEO

| Parameter | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| Initial orbit (LEO) | 300 km, r₁ = 6,678 km |
| Final orbit (GEO) | 35,786 km, r₂ = 42,164 km |
| First burn (Δv₁) | 2.428 km/s |
| Transfer time | 5.27 hours |
| Second burn (Δv₂) | 1.472 km/s |
| **Total Δv** | **3.900 km/s** |

## 5.3 Plane Change Maneuvers

Changing orbital inclination:

```
Δv = 2v·sin(Δi/2)
```
*Equation 5.7*

> **⚠️ Plane Changes Are Expensive!**  
> A 30° inclination change at LEO (~7.7 km/s) requires ~4 km/s - more than Hohmann to GEO!

## 5.4 Delta-V Budget

| Maneuver | Typical Δv |
|----------|-----------|
| Launch to LEO | ~9.4 km/s |
| LEO to GTO | ~2.5 km/s |
| GTO to GEO | ~1.5 km/s |
| LEO to Moon | ~3.2 km/s |
| LEO to Mars | ~3.6 km/s |

# 6. INTERPLANETARY MISSION DESIGN

## 6.1 Patched Conic Approximation

Divide trajectory into regions where only one body's gravity dominates.

### Sphere of Influence

```
r_SOI ≈ a·(m_planet/M_sun)^(2/5)
```
*Equation 6.1*

| Planet | SOI Radius (km) |
|--------|----------------|
| Earth | 924,000 |
| Mars | 577,000 |
| Jupiter | 48,200,000 |

### Trajectory Phases

1. **Departure:** Escape from Earth's SOI
2. **Cruise:** Heliocentric transfer ellipse
3. **Arrival:** Enter Mars's SOI

## 6.2 Lambert's Problem

Given two position vectors and transfer time, find the required initial velocity.

### Minimum Energy Transfer

```
a_min = s/2
where s = (r₁ + r₂ + c)/2
```
*Equation 6.3*

## 6.3 Launch Windows

### Synodic Period

```
T_syn = 1/|1/T₁ - 1/T₂|
```
*Equation 6.4*

For Earth-Mars: T_syn ≈ 780 days (26 months)

### Earth-Mars Mission

| Parameter | Typical Value |
|-----------|--------------|
| Launch window duration | ~30 days |
| Transfer time | ~260 days |
| Departure C3 | 10-20 km²/s² |
| Arrival V∞ | 2-4 km/s |
| Total Δv (from LEO) | ~6-8 km/s |

# 7. ADVANCED TRAJECTORY DESIGN

## 7.1 Low-Thrust Trajectories

Electric propulsion provides continuous low thrust:

```
a_thrust = (T/m)·û_thrust
```
*Equation 7.1*

Creates spiral trajectories over weeks/months instead of distinct transfer ellipses.

## 7.2 Gravity Assists

Use a planet's gravity to change spacecraft velocity without propellant.

Maximum velocity change:

```
Δv_max = 2v_planet
```
*Equation 7.2*

### Famous Missions

| Mission | Route | Purpose |
|---------|-------|---------|
| Voyager 2 | J→S→U→N | Grand tour |
| Cassini | V→V→E→J→S | Reach Saturn |
| Parker Solar Probe | Multiple Venus | Reach Sun |
